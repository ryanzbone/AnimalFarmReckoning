##Gameplay

In this game you shoot animals instead of bullets. Your goal is to knock your opponent out of the arena, similar to Super Smash Brothers. You do this by collecting the items that fall from the top of the screen. Each item gives you a different type of ammo. There are mice, elephants, pigs and more. Each ammo type has a different maximum capacity as well, so be careful to conserve ammo until you have a good shot or you may find yourself out of ammo when you need it most.
